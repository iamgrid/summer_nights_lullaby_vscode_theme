# Summer Nights Lullaby - VS Code Theme

Dark theme with strongly reduced blue light for those late-night coding sessions when you're planning to go to sleep right after.

If you do this regularly, I suggest also getting [f.lux](https://justgetflux.com/) which adjusts color temps system-wide automatically, based on the current position of the sun at your GPS coordinates.
